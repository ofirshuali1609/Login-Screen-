Hi David,

Attached is my Java project simulating a Windows login screen.

The project utilizes mutual exclusion to ensure that the login process is handled correctly even in a concurrent environment.

Introduction: Your details have already been initialized in the main method, including your name and email.
I have set an initial password for you.

Password: 1A23
